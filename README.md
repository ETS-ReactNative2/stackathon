# PlanIt

PlanIt is a mobile application for sharing and viewing successful plans and events such as birthday parties, brunches, and dinners.  Users share information such as the plan description, location, number of people, price per person, and any tips they have.  Users can also search for ideas when making a plan based on the activity they have in mind, the size of their group, and the amount each person would be willing to spend.
